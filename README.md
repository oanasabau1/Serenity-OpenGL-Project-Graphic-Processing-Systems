## Serenity

Embark on a personal journey into the enchanting world of 3D graphics with my project, where OpenGL, GLEW, GLM, GLFW, and Blender converge to weave digital wonders. Unleash the power of OpenGL for real-time rendering, extend capabilities with GLEW, and wield GLM for mathematical sorcery. Manage windows effortlessly with GLFW, and seamlessly integrate Blender assets for an extra touch of magic. Dive into shader programming for visual enchantment and create cross-platform spells. 
I've created a world where silence predominates: a simple cottage surrounded by fauna, flora, water, hills, and mountains. That's why it is called Serenity. 
This project was developed for the Graphis Proccesing Systems' assignment and follows a scene of 3D objects created in Blender and functionalities like: navigating in the scene, doing model or camera transformations (using the peripheral system - mouse and keyboard), having an intro animation, having a source of light and creating shadows using the Shadow Mapping technique, added fog effect, and, finally, created photorealism and verosimility.

Here's a preview of my project:
